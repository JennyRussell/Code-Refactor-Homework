    In this homework assignment, I was tasked with refactoring the html and css code of an existing site according to the user story. I also had to ensure that all acceptance criteria requirements were met.

## User Story

    I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
    SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines


## Acceptance Critera

    -GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
    -WHEN I view the source code
     THEN I find semantic HTML elements
    -WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
     THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
    -WHEN I view the image elements
     THEN I find accessible alt attributes
    -WHEN I view the heading attributes
     THEN they fall in sequential order
    -WHEN I view the title element
